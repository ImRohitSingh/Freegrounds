        1. The game is played on a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares.\n
        2. You are X, your friend (or the app in Single Player mode) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.\n
        3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.\n
        4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
